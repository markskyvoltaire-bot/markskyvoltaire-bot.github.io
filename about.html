      <p>
        I’m Sky Voltaire—born in Paris, raised across Haiti, Chicago, and D.C., and shaped by a life full of movement, music, and stories. My journey has always been about blending cultures and experiences into something authentic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Music grabbed me early. At 11, I was writing stories; by 14, those stories became lyrics. Meeting my friend Golden at 19 changed everything—we formed Northstar International and connected with collaborators like SleepWalker, Donyel, and Telly. Since then, we’ve been chasing the craft together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Life hasn’t always been smooth. I’ve faced loss, challenges, and balancing acts between personal life and music—but each experience has fueled my growth as an artist and storyteller.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspiration strikes without warning. My creative process is fluid, passionate, and persistent—always searching for that next sound, story, or rhythm.
